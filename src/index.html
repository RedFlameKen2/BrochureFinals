                                        <p class="review">The condo is in a good location near a small shopping centre, cafes and convenience store. The room is neat, comfortable and there was housekeeping everyday. The only down side is that if you wish to shop in the bigger shopping malls ie. Glorietta \& Greenbelt you have to walk at least 20-30 mins in the heat, traffic and through polluted air to get there as catching a taxi/grab is not worth it and you'll probably get there faster by walking. Will probably stay at again if there are no other accommodation available much nearer the big shopping centres mentioned above next time we're in the Philippines. </p>

                                        <p class="review">The unit is very big and the rooms are comfortable. The place is well equipped for families who would want to also do light cooking. Since the place is new, the furniture is nice but there are already signs of wear and tear. There are convenience stores nearby and Centuria Mall is just 50 meters away. The service is great from the reception to the housekeeping. The only downside is parking is not provided and there are construction activities right in front and beside the building.</p>
